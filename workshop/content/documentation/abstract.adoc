This hands-on workshop will lead you through a series of self-paced labs covering many, emerging, areas where *wasm* and OCI work together.

    * Building
    * Running
    * Signing
    * Internals - what is going on
    * Simple benchmarking and performance
    * Kubernetes (Microshift)

    /* TODO: Add link */
                    
And plenty more... 

You are encouraged to bring your own work and experiment with it but source code is provided throughout.

Enjoy!
